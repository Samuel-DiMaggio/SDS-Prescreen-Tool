# SDS Prescreen Tool with included steps for converting a python file to an EXE using Nuitka
This tool utilizes tokenization from the NLP library to search through a given Safety Data Sheet (SDS) to identify chemicals of interest that pertain to federal and international regulatory requirements. This was a project that I worked on as a Regulatory Analyst for a chemical company that specialized on adhesives for consumer and industrial products. The main purpose was to quickly identify chemicals that are listed on mulitple federal and international regulatory lists. In the first half wil be the python code that I wrote for this project. This contains a simple GUI input and output for a easy user experience. In the second half of this project, there will be a reference guide on  how to convert a python file to a executable file using Nuitka.
